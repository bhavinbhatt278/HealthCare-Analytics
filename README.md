HeartAttack Prediction using Statistical tests and Machine Learning Algorithms

Heart Attack prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XG Boost
Different Statistical tests such as Shapiro Wilk Test, Mann Whitney U and correlation matrix were used feature Selection.
I did try different combinations of techniques for Class balance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority OverSampling technique) , class_weighted - Balance and other techniques
Also used other cross validation techniques to see the difference in results.
